# Step 3: Retrieve tweets
# Caveat: "Before getting involved, itâ€™s important to know that the Search API
# is focused on relevance and not completeness. This means that some Tweets and
# users may be missing from search results. If you want to match for
# completeness you should consider using a Streaming API instead."

# Note: make use of geocode query parameter to filter by region?
# Note: despite the doc says the bearer token must be base64 encoded it's
# actually not the case. Sending the token we received verbatim (which seems
# to be URL encoded already) is all that's required.
# TODO: remember max tweet id received and use since_id to search only newer.
